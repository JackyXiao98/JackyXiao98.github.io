I am a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, under the supervision of Prof. [Daniel Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/) and Prof. [Danfeng Zhang](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/). 

I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China, where I was supervised by Prof. [Juyong Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~juyong/index.html). I also visited University of Nanyang Technological University as a research assistant, under the supervision of Dr. [Yong Liu](http://www.yongliu.org/).

I'm interested in differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, privacy preserving machine learning.
