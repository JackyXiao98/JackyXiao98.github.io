I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/) and [Prof. Danfeng Zhang](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/). I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from School of Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China.

I'm interested in differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, privacy preserving machine learning.
