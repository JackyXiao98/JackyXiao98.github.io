I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Kifer and Dr. Danfeng Zhang. I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China.

I'm interested in differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, privacy preserving machine learning.
